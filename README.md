# Snake-Tron

Fun little game written in high school that combines snake and Tron.

The pink snake is controlled by WASD. The blue snake is controlled by the arrow keys.

Eating the red "apple" grows the tail.

If you hit the edge, your tail, or your opponent's tail, you will die. This gives your opponent a point.

That's about it.
